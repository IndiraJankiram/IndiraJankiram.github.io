<h1>Welcome To Indira's Portfolio!!</h1>
<p id="first">I am a senior at Rutgers Business School pursuing a double major in Finance and Business Analytics Information Technology (BAIT).
    I am a highly motivated and ambitious student with an interest in the financial markets. I enjoy learning about where the markets currently stand and how the financial system virtually plays a role within the artificial intelligence world. 
    I am excited to further my knowledge about the Finance/Investment world and gain a unique perspective on national and international markets and economies through hands-on experience.
    I like to meet my career goals through LIBOR, more specifically Bender's Trust. This is a case competition where I was tasked with pitching a stock to potential investors. I am also looking to invest in the financial markets, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know! 
    I enjoy meeting new people, so do not hesitate to contact me! 
    I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
